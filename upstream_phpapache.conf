### Upstream configuration for Apache functioning has a PHP handler.

## Add as many servers as needed.
## Cf. http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpUpstreamModule.
## Note that this configuration assumes by default that keepalive
## upstream connections are supported and that you have a Nginx
## version with the fair load balancer.

upstream phpapache {
    ## If your version of Nginx doesn't have the fair load balancer:
    ## https://github.com/gnosek/nginx-upstream-fair comment out the
    ## following line.
    fair;
    server 127.0.0.1:8080;
    server 127.0.0.1:8081;
    ## Create a backend connection cache. Note that this requires
    ## Nginx version greater or equal to 1.1.4.
    ## Cf. http://nginx.org/en/CHANGES. Comment out the following
    ## line if that's not the case.
    keepalive 5;
}

## Add a third pool as a fallback.
upstream phpapache_backup {
    server 127.0.0.1:8082;
    ## Create a backend connection cache. Note that this requires
    ## Nginx version greater or equal to 1.1.4.
    ## Cf. http://nginx.org/en/CHANGES. Comment out the
    ## following line if that's not the case.
    keepalive 1;
}
